# java script
This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files. 

**When the browser comes across a <script> element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.**

1. It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
2. The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

3. If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
