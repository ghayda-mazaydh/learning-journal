# programming with JavaScript

## The Script: 
is a series of instructions a computer can follow step by step

## how to write a script:
1. state your goal 
2. list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
3.  CODE EACH STEP 

*You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them.*

### EXPRESSIONS
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 

### operater 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.*

 **There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.**

 ## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
 Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. 
 to create a function:
 1. give it a name
 2. **function declaration** write the statments needed to achive the task inside curly braces
 3. **calling a function** excute all the statments between its curly braces
